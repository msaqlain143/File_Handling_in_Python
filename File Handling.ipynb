    "In Python, file handling is crucial for various web applications. The access modes control the types of activities that can be performed on an opened file and determine the position of the file handle within the file, akin to a pointer. There are six main access modes in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read Only ('r'):** Opens the text file for reading only. Raises an I/O error if the file doesn't exist. The file handle is positioned at the start of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read and Write ('r+'):** Opens the file for both reading and writing. If the file doesn't exist, it raises an I/O error. The file handle is placed at the start of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write Only ('w'):** Opens the file for writing only. Modifies and overwrites the data in existing files. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one. The file handle is positioned at the start of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write and Read ('w+'):** Opens the file for both reading and writing. It overwrites and deletes existing text in the file. The file handle is positioned at the start of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Append Only ('a'):** Opens the file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist. The handle is set at the end of the file, allowing new data to be added at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Append and Read ('a+'):** Enables reading and writing in the file. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist. The handle is set at the end of the file, allowing newly written text to be added at the end.\n",
    "\n",
